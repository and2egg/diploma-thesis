...

As Qureshi et al.~pointed out in \cite{qureshi2009cutting} most companies would need to renegotiate their energy contracts in order to utilize the proposed approach. Companies renting space in co-location facilities usually pay a fixed price for energy rather than directly taking part in the price offers of wholesale markets. 

Demand response programs are a way of further decreasing energy costs as consumers agree on a reduced price in exchange for a reduced load when it is requested by the grid operator\cite{albadi2008summary}. This is certainly interesting for energy elastic distributed systems that are able to shift load to other locations dynamically.
