\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Ivona Brandic for supporting me throughout the whole process. She gave me valuable hints and suggestions on how to improve my work and concentrate on relevant topics. I would also like to thank Drazen Lucanin who has been extremely helpful 
in providing advice and support as well as assist in issues regarding implementation. Last but not least I want to thank my family for their continuous support, without it this work would not have been possible.
