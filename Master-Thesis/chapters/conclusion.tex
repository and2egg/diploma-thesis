ARIMA models showed reasonably good performance, in many cases they showed the best results compared to other evaluated models in this work. 



\section{Future Work}


Forecasting models may be improved, or different models may be investigated based on electricity price data. 

Dynamic Regression (DR) and Transfer function (TF) models have been shown to provide a significantly better performance than ARIMA models \cite{aggarwal2009electricity,weron2005forecasting}. This may be due to the additional regressor variables that are considered in multivariate models (DR and TF) in contrast to models based on a single univariate time series (ARIMA). 

In general multivariate models seem to provide better results than univariate models as they are able to include more information into the model generation process \cite{weron2005forecasting}.
