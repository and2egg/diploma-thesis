\subsection{VM Migrations and Forecasting}

{\hfill\today}
\vspace{0.4cm}

Forecasting can only be made for individual workloads on different servers / data centers. 
But are forecasts of 5 to 10 days even possible when migration of virtual machines is included? 
Suppose a job runs on multiple VMs, and it is migrated in some point in time. Considering all servers and data centers
it is not possible to predict each migration, as it soon gets too complex. 
So the purpose of forecasts can only be a vague estimate of what might be advantageous in the future? 


\emph{BUT} of course in terms of energy prices forecasts perfectly make sense in that you can predict the price for
certain areas and data centers. Then you can check if the prices will significantly differ for a longer period of time 
in the future. It makes sense also for short term considerations. 

For example, there is a situation where a migration seems beneficial in that moment, but looking ahead one can see that
migrating wouldn't be worth it and it is better to do nothing. 


\subsection{Workloads and test data}

Open Questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item How should workloads be generated?
	\subitem -> workloads are CPU traces of programs, probably distributed across several CPUs (CPU power load)
\item Which programs should be used? 
	\subitem Matlab
	\subitem R
	\subitem Mathcad
	\subitem \ldots
\item Which kind of distribution should they exhibit (time series)?
\item Is there a way to get workload data / time series data from real data centers?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workload traces}

A workload trace is common for all data centers, since they are administrated from one central point. 
From there the workload is distributed across the data centers, already taking into account electricity cost. 
When a new request arrives, it is checked whether the application can be served at any of the data centers. 
If not, the start is delayed until resources are available. Otherwise it is assigned to the presumably cheapest
data center. If later the prices change load will be migrated from more expensive to cheaper data centers.
