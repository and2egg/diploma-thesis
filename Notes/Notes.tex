\section{Expose}

\subsection{VM Migrations and Forecasting}

{\hfill\today}
\vspace{0.4cm}

Forecasting can only be made for individual workloads on different servers / data centers. 
But are forecasts of 5 to 10 days even possible when migration of virtual machines is included? 
Suppose a job runs on multiple VMs, and it is migrated in some point in time. Considering all servers and data centers
it is not possible to predict each migration, as it soon gets too complex. 
So the purpose of forecasts can only be a vague estimate of what might be advantageous in the future? 


\emph{BUT} of course in terms of energy prices forecasts perfectly make sense in that you can predict the price for
certain areas and data centers. Then you can check if the prices will significantly differ for a longer period of time 
in the future. It makes sense also for short term considerations. 

For example, there is a situation where a migration seems beneficial in that moment, but looking ahead one can see that
migrating wouldn't be worth it and it is better to do nothing. 


\subsection{Workloads and test data}

Open Questions:

\begin{itemize}

\item How should workloads be generated?
	\subitem -> workloads are CPU traces of programs, probably distributed across several CPUs (CPU power load)
	\subitem -> define applications to run with different workloads
	
\item Which programs should be used? 
	\subitem \underline{Matlab}
	\subitem R
	\subitem Mathcad
	\subitem \ldots
\item Which kind of distribution should they exhibit (time series)?
\item Is there a way to get workload traces / time series data from real data centers?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Workload traces}

A workload trace is common for all data centers, since they are administrated from one central point. 
From there the workload is distributed across the data centers, already taking into account electricity cost. 
When a new request arrives, it is checked whether the application can be served at any of the data centers. 
If not, the start is delayed until resources are available. Otherwise it is assigned to the presumably cheapest
data center. If later the prices change load will be migrated from more expensive to cheaper data centers. 


\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Data Center Locations}

The framework will comprise seven data centers located in different countries and assigned to four different energy markets, namely the 
European energy exchange (EEX)\footnote{EEX: European energy exchange, http://www.eex.com/}, Nord Pool Spot\footnote{Nord Pool Spot, http://www.nordpoolspot.com/}, APX Power Spot Exchange\footnote{APX Power Spot Exchange, http://www.apxgroup.com/} and ISO New England\footnote{ISO New England, http://www.iso-ne.com/}. 


\subsection{Power markets}

\subsubsection{EEX}

PHELIX: Physical Electricity Index: Germany, Austria

ELIX: Electricity Index: ?

SWISSIX: Swiss Index: Switzerland

FRENCH FINANCIAL POWER FUTURES: France


\subsection{Forecasting}

A good explanation of forecasting can be found at \cite{weka2011weka} (from the weka forecasting tool). 
This is especially valid for time series forecasting but can be applied to other methods as well. 

\subsubsection{Models}

\begin{itemize}

\item Neural Networks

Finding some specifics on NN models ..

\item Regression Trees

Model (Regression) trees are decision trees with linear regression functions at the leaves. 

\item ...

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
\item Migration Overhead / Costs

\item On/Off Peak Prices (e.g. UK, when no hourly prices are available)

\item different Time Zones

		Boston, Portland (-5)
		UK (UTC)
		Germany (+1)
		Finland(+2)
		
\item Considering cooling? 

		Fan/Chillers, turned off/on, which speed etc. 
		depending on outside temperature
		
\item Which kind of workload?

		applications running for short/long amount of time? 
		
\item Power consumption behavior

		Idle Servers
		
		Partially utilized Servers (max. 1 -> negligible)
		EXCEPT having jobs with different CPU-core demand
		
		Fully utilized Servers
		
\item What kind of forecasting? 

		Short term (day ahead, few days)
		
		Mid term (half a month up to a few months)
		
		Long term (half a year up to a few years)

\item How many VMs moved in one step? 

		May be defined, such that the migration pays concerning the running jobs. 

\item Considering different kinds of energy sources (renewables, Atom, fossils etc.)?

		Possible consideration in scheduling algorithm. Choosing priorities for either price or green IT. 

\end{itemize}


\section{Cooling}

Questions

\begin{itemize}

\item Should the costs of the cooling infrastructure be considered when running the simulation, or for the thesis at all? 

\item which cooling infrastructure should be used for the data centers? 

	-> get some estimations or examples from real world data centers
	
	-> build a model

\item How to define when chillers need to be turned on? At which temperature?

\item Differ chillers and fans? Time to switch on / off? Costs / Energy? 

\end{itemize}
