\section{Goal Setting}

The goal of this thesis is to show ways for data center operators in charge of geographically distributed and interconnected data centers to save on their power bill by exploiting VM migrations and the variability of energy prices in wholesale power markets. This approach presumes that data center operators are charged directly by wholesale power markets, which is the case already for a few data centers to date. Given the fact that data centers consume a huge amount of energy (several megawatts) that could power whole cities it becomes a viable option to integrate them into wholesale energy markets. By leveraging the technique of resource migration to data centers where cheaper energy prices apply at the current point in time significant savings in energy bills are possible while still maintaining a defined level of quality of service. 

By initially placing resources at data centers that currently exhibit cheap energy prices the energy expense can be reduced compared to a non power aware approach. Combined with energy price forecasts resources may be scheduled intelligently such that price changes within the near future can be detected and resources are placed with respect to the estimated prices. This approach may be evaluated against an ad-hoc approach where resources are assigned to data centers by only considering current energy prices and workload. 

A simulation scenario will be established where workload is placed on several geographically distributed and interconnected data centers and results are evaluated based on the given workload, energy prices and data center capacities. In addition energy price forecasts will be integrated to predict significant changes in energy price levels at different energy markets. This should lead to a more cost efficient scheduling approach where workload is placed at data centers which provide best energy price conditions for the current and/or future time stamps. 

The simulation will be based on a well established cloud scheduler\footnote{https://philharmonic.github.io/} with set parameters to simulate a predefined scenario. The results for different scenarios and parameter settings (i.e.~with or without forecasts) will be compared and evaluated such that the possible benefit of these approaches can be examined. 
In addition to energy prices and workload this scheduler may take into account cooling costs related to ambient temperatures around the data centers which may be considered as well when running the simulation. 

A special focus will be laid on evaluating energy price forecasting methods to find the best fit for the given data and scenarios. For the simulation there will be a focus on short term price forecasting, as energy price levels change rapidly within energy markets and exhibit a very volatile nature. %a short period of time 
Different forecasting methods will be compared by accuracy and error measures to determine the most suitable forecasting horizon and parameter settings for various models. It is expected that through good quality forecasting the results of the simulation in terms of energy costs can be improved significantly which should help cloud providers to save on their energy bills and provide more efficient scheduling of cloud related data. 


\section{Wholesale power markets}

\subsection{Integration of DCs into power markets}

- Possibility of getting lower energy prices (compared to flatrate)

- Possibility of providing power services back to markets (for large DCs / Cloud Providers) when there is an excess of energy\footnote{Data Center Trends: Optimizing power markets \url{http://www.datacenterworld.com/fall2013/account/Uploader/uploader\_files/show/335/}}

\section{Definition of Terms}

\begin{itemize}

\item Power Usage Effectiveness

Developed by The Green Grid, Power usage effectiveness (PUE) is a data center metric that measures the amount of power directly used by IT resources such as servers and routers compared to the overall energy consumption of the data center. A PUE value of 2 means that there is as much energy used to power non-IT equipment such as cooling facilities etc. as there is to power IT devices. 
% takes the total power used by a data center and divides it by the amount of power used by the IT hardware housed in the data center. (source: http://tech.ebay.com/about-dashboard)

\item Energy Elasticity

Denotes the degree to which the energy consumed by a cluster depends on the load placed on it. Ideally, clusters would draw no power in the absence of load. In the worst case, there would be no difference between the peak power and the idle power of a cluster. Present state-of-the-art systems fall somewhere in the middle, with idle power being around 60\% \cite{qureshi2009cutting}.

\item Colocation providers

A colocation provider denotes a facility manager that provides space and server infrastructures to industrial customers that rent the space and infrastructure to house their customers' applications. 

\end{itemize}


\section{Forecasting}

\subsection{Definition}

A very general definition of forecasting and its prerequisites is given here\footnote{O-Texts https://www.otexts.org/fpp/1/1}:

\begin{quote}
The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:

\begin{itemize}
\item how well we understand the factors that contribute to it
\item how much data are available
\item whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}


\subsection{Types of forecasting}

%Forecasting can be done in different ways, each having their own drawbacks and benefits. 

Forecasting methods can be classified into two categories: Qualitative and Quantitative forecasting. 

\subsubsection{Qualitative forecasting}
Qualitative forecasting methods assume that there is no or no relevant data that can be used to make forecasts. This is the case for forecasts that aim to predict i.e. the first year's sales of a new product line or the expected profit of a newly created startup company. In both examples there is no data available beforehand and the forecast has to be derived from already known conditions also called predictor variables. 

\subsubsection{Quantitative forecasting}
Qantitative forecasting methods are based on numerical historical data, from which forecasts are derived. It is assumed that the data´s pattern over time stays the same or will behave in a similar way in the future. 

Quantitative forecasting methods can again be classified roughly into two categories: Cross-sectional forecasting and Time Series forecasting. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Cross-sectional forecasts collect data from a single point in time to predict a value for an item not in the dataset. For example, prices of real estates in a specific area and point in time are collected and the price for another real estate is estimated based on predictor variables (i.e., size of properties and number of floors). 

\item Time series forecasts are solely based on historical data from the value to be predicted. No other variables are considered for the calculation, which on the one hand might miss some influential factors from external conditions but on the other hand appears to be more accurate regarding the output of the forecasts. 
In case of energy price forecasts external variables that change energy price behavior might include bids in auctions of wholesale energy markets, the current oil price or availability of renewable energy sources. However, in time series forecasts these variables are neglected to set the focus on the time series of historical energy prices. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Forecast accuracy}

There are different kinds of accuracy measures that can be applied to forecasting methods. \footnote{https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/5}

\subsubsection{Scale-dependent error measures}

Scale dependent errors are absolute error measures given in the same scale as the dataset that is examined. Thus they are most useful when testing fc methods on the same dataset or on the same scale, respectively. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Mean absolute error (MAE)
The absolute error is defined by the value difference between a value of the dataset and its forecasted value. The mean absolute error returns the mean of all absolute errors on the dataset. [insert formula]

\item Root mean squared error (RMSE)
The root mean squared error takes the root of the sum of the squared forecast errors, and is scale dependent as well. [insert formula]

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Percentage error measures}

The most common percentage error is the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) which is defined as the mean of percentage errors of a dataset. A percentage error is defined as $p_i=e_i/y_i * 100$. The mean absolute percentage error is then $mean(|pi|)$. 

The disadvantage of percentage error measures is that the value becomes infinite if there is some $y_i = 0$ on the dataset. Also, extreme values occur when the values on the dataset come close to zero. 



\subsection{Forecast models}

\subsubsection{ARIMA models}


\subsubsection{Exponential Smoothing models}


\subsection{Forecast model evaluation}

\subsubsection{Tests for appropriateness of forecasting models}

If a model has been chosen, it needs to be tested to ensure its applicability for the given dataset. 



\section{Time Series Processing}

\subsection{Decomposition of time series}

Decomposition of time series can be helpful to determine various trends and patterns in the dataset. Based on recognized patterns and a thorough analysis of the data´s behavior and characteristics an appropriate forecasting model can be chosen. 

A time series exhibiting a trend, seasonal variations and random fluctuations can be decomposed into a trend component, seasonal component and irregular component, respectively. 







\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Data Center Locations}

Data center locations have been chosen such that they are placed in areas where a wholesale electricity market is available. For some locations data has been generated based on distribution of data in actual power markets. 

Price and temperature data is available for the following locations throughout the year 2010: 

Belgium - St. Ghislain

Singapore - Singapore

Taiwan - Changhua County

Indiana - Indianapolis

Michigan - Detroit

\subsection{Power markets}

Various power markets exist that provide data about historical energy prices. For simplicity, real data was taken for locations in the US and based on that generated for the other locations. The prices have been normalized to values between 0 and 1 based on maximum and minimum values in the dataset. Therefore, prices can be compared directly and do not need to be converted. 

\subsection{Parameters}

\begin{itemize}
\item Migration Overhead / Costs

\item On/Off Peak Prices

\item different Time Zones
		
\item Cooling depending on outside temperatures
		
\item Types of workload - short / long running jobs
		
\item Elasticity level of servers
		
\item Type(s) of forecasting - short term, mid term, long term

\item Minimum number of VMs to migrate in order to amortize migration costs

\item Possible consideration of different energy sources - renewables, atom, fossils

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Dynamic request routing}

\begin{itemize}

\item Load balancing of data of requests over all data centers

\item Determination of the currently cheapest data center

\item Possibly combined with forecasting energy prices

\item Integrating load forecasting as an additional measure

\item Estimation of DC load based on current DC load

\end{itemize}

\subsection{VM Migration}

\begin{itemize}

\item Minimum job duration for amortization of costs

\item Same VM / DC Selection Mechanism as with dynamic request routing

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation models}

\begin{itemize}

\item Create scenarios both with and without forecasting

\item Evaluation of simulation results, overall power consumption/costs

\item Mapping power consumption to energy costs

\item Derive power consumption based on CPU load and possibly other parameters. Depends on elasticity

\item Model migration costs, depending on the workload

\end{itemize}
