\subsection{Electricity markets and pricing}

In wholesale energy markets different pricing and bidding models can be used. 

Currently the two most common price evaluation strategies are day-ahead and real-time pricing strategies. 

In \cite{uniform2008tierney} two different bidding strategies are discussed, uniform pricing and pay-as-bid auctions. In the uniform pricing model the market clearing price is determined by collecting the marginal prices from all suppliers and taking the maximum price from this collection. Conversely, in pay-as-bid auctions a supplier gets paid based on its actual bid.
