\subsection{Energy markets}

\subsubsection{Nord Pool Spot}


The NordPoolSpot market is the most mature power market to date and has been the first energy market that was established in Europe [c]. 

The NordPoolSpot power market consists of four different markets. [c BEGIN]

\begin{itemize}[-]

\item Financial market (Nasdaq OMX)
Used for managing risks. Cash settled futures,
forwards and options. Contracts can be made for
up to six years. The system price is used as
reference price.

\item Day-ahead market (Nord Pool Spot)
Day-ahead auction of power for delivery the next
day. Nord Pool Spot calculates power prices
based on supply and demand for every hour the
following day.

\item Intraday market (Nord Pool Spot)
Continuous trading up to 30 minutes before
delivery to adjust power production or
consumption plans.

\item Balancing market (TSOs)
Operated by the respective transmission system
operators. Final adjustments are made to ensure
the correct frequency in the grid and security of
supply

\end{itemize}

\emph{The future is Europe}

The future of power trading lies in the
creation of a single, integrated
European market and an integrated
platform.
This will be the most advanced power
market yet, offering efficiency in:

\begin{itemize}
\item Membership
\item Management of collateral
\item Cost
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Nord Pool Spot - Day ahead market}

[c BEGIN]

The day-ahead market, Elspot , is the main arena for trading power in the Nordic and Baltic region. Here, contracts are made between seller and buyer for the delivery of power the following day, the price is set and the trade is agreed.

Today there are around 360 buyers and sellers (called members) on Elspot. Most of them trade every day, placing a total of around 2000 orders for power contracts on a daily basis.

\emph{Driven by planning}

Daily trading is driven by the members’ planning. A buyer, typically a utility, needs to assess how much energy (‘volume’) it will need to meet demand the following day, and how much it is willing to pay for this volume, hour by hour. The seller, for example the owner of a hydroelectric power plant, needs to decide how much he can deliver and at what price, hour by hour. These needs are reflected through orders entered by buyers and sellers into the Elspot trading system.

\emph{Setting the price and closing the deal}

12:00 CET is the deadline for submitting bids for power which will be delivered the following day. Elspot feeds the information into a specialist computer system which calculates the price, based on an advanced algorithm. Put simply, the price is set where the curves for sell price and buy price meet.

\emph{Supply and demand}


Hourly prices are typically announced to the market at 12:42 CET or later. Once the market prices have been calculated, trades are settled. From 00:00 CET the next day, power contracts are physically delivered (meaning that the power is provided to the buyer) hour for hour according to the contracts agreed.

\emph{The cost of transmission constraints}

While supply and demand are the key factors determining the hourly market prices, transmission capacity also plays a role. Bottlenecks can occur where power connections are linked to each other, if large volumes need to be transmitted to meet demand. To relieve this congestion, different area prices are introduced. In other words, when transmission capacity gets constrained, the price is raised to reduce demand in the areas affected.

\subsubsection{Nord Pool Spot - Intraday market}

[c BEGIN]

Elbas  is an intraday market for trading power operated by Nord Pool Spot. Covering the Nordic and Baltic region as well as Germany and recently extended to include the UK, Elbas supplements Elspot and helps secure the necessary balance between supply and demand in the power market for Northern Europe.

The majority of the volume handled by Nord Pool Spot is traded on the day-ahead market. For the most part, the balance between supply and demand is secured here. However, incidents may take place between the closing of Elspot at noon CET and delivery the next day. A nuclear power plant may stop operating in Sweden, or strong winds may cause higher power generation than planned at wind turbine plants in Germany. At Elbas, buyers and sellers can trade volumes close to real time to bring the market back in balance.

Trading close to real time

At 14:00 CET, capacities available for Elbas trading are published. Elbas is a continuous market, and trading takes place every day around the clock until one hour before delivery. Prices are set based on a first-come, first-served principle, where best prices come first – highest buy price and lowest sell price.

Increasingly important

The intraday market is becoming increasingly important as more wind power enters the grid. Wind power is unpredictable by nature, and imbalances between day-ahead contracts and produced volume often need to be offset. Elbas will play a key role in the development of intraday power trading in Europe. Future prospects indicate exponential growth, reaching 1.900 GW installed wind capacity worldwide in 2020 (Source: World Wind Energy Association). This type of market can be a key enabler to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix.

\subsubsection{ISO New England}

The market of ISO New England is located at \url{http://www.iso-ne.com/}. It offers day ahead as well as real time energy prices where day ahead prices are available at an hourly interval while (preliminary) real time prices are available both at hourly and five minute intervals. 

Current locational marginal prices (LMPs) can be downloaded from a base url\footnote{\url{http://www.iso-ne.com/static-transform/csv/histRpts/da-lmp/}} and a specialized suffix depending on the file and date\footnote{WW\_DALMP\_ISO\_20150414.csv}. In this case, files are provided in csv format for better machine processing. 

Example: 
\begin{verbatim}
	H,"Date","Hour Ending","Location ID","Location Name","Location Type","Locational Marginal Price",
	"Energy Component","Congestion Component","Marginal Loss Component"
	D,"04/14/2015","02","4006",".Z.SEMASS","LOAD ZONE",14.82,14.85,0.01,-0.04

\subsection{Definitions}

\subsubsection{Definition of 'Clearing Price'}

The following is a definition of clearing price from Investopedia\footnote{\url{http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingprice.asp}}. 

\begin{quote}
The specified monetary value assigned to a security or asset. This price is determined by the bid and ask process of buyers and sellers interested in trading the security.

In any exchange, sellers prefer to part with their assets for the highest price possible while investors interested in buying the same asset desire the lowest purchase price possible. At some point, a mutually agreeable price is reached between buyers and sellers. It is at this point that economists say the market has "cleared" and transactions take place. Thus, the clearing price of an asset is the price at which it was most recently traded.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Forward Capacity Market (FCM)}

A forward capacity market is used to ensure having enough capacity for a specific amount of time into the future. A capacity commitment period (CCP) ensures that a certain amount of capacity will be available during that period. For example, the CCP at ISO-NE is set as one year ranging from June 1st until May 31st. 

The market has to ensure that the \emph{Installed Capacity Requirements (ICR)} for the corresponding region are met. These requirements are defined for each capacity commitment period and define the amount of capacity needed to meet estimated peak and reserve demands. Important measures to define the ICR are the local sourcing requirements (LSR) and maximum capacity limits (MCL) that define the constraints given by market participants. %(QUOTE)In addition the Hydro-Québec Interconnection Capability Credits (HQICCs), are a key input into the calculation of the ICR.

The actual procurement of resources for each capacity commitment period is determined by a \emph{Forward Capacity Auction (FCA)} which aims to meet the defined ICRs for the given period.
This auction is carried out three years ahead of the related CCP to ensure that enough resources will be available during that period. \emph{Reconfiguration Auctions (RA)} are then executed annually until the start of the CCP and continued monthly afterward. During an RA capacity resources may be amended to adapt to potential changes in capacity zones. 

At the FCM of ISO New England there is also the option of making a composite offer where different capacity resources may join their capacity offers (useful i.e.~in case of single season capacities) to result in a single resource offer at the market. 

Capacity resources <-> energy suppliers/providers?

See definition at the website of ISO NE\footnote{\url{http://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/forward-capacity-market}}.

\subsubsection{Regulation market}

Definition by the ISO NE power market\footnote{\url{http://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/markets/regulation-market}}:

\begin{quote}
The Regulation Market is the mechanism for selecting and compensating market participants to provide regulation—the capability of specially equipped generators and other energy sources to increase or decrease output or consumption every four seconds. Participants allow their Automatic Generation Control (AGC) resources to be controlled by the ISO using automated signals to balance both second-by-second variations in demand and the system frequency, which must be kept constant. This market helps ensure that the ISO meets the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Real Power Balancing Control Performance Standard (BAL-001-0). Two regulation clearing prices are calculated: one for capacity and one for actual service mileage.
\end{quote}




\subsubsection{Two settlement system: Day ahead vs Balancing market}

A two settlement system has been defined for the PJM power market (PJM standing for Pennsylvania, Jersey, Maryland)\cite{lambert2001creating}. 

A two-settlement system in power markets is understood as a system comprising a day ahead as well as a real time (balancing) power market\cite{lambert2001creating}.
